I wanted to get a simple report about how many errors on Bugsnag does my project have from version to version. Now I have it.

# Installation

I have no idea how to package python apps. If you have, go ahead and create a pull request. Basically, just download the script and make sure you have the packages it needs.

# Usage

`./bugsnag-errors.py --api-key API_KEY --project-id PROJECT_ID`

Replace API_KEY with your api key, and PROJECT_ID with, you guessed it, with PROJECT_ID.
